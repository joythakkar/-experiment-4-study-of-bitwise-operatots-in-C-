Theory:

Bitwise operators in C++ are used to perform operations at the bit level. These operators directly manipulate the binary representations of data, making them efficient for low-level programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
C++ provides the following bitwise operators:

& (Bitwise AND):
Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
Example: a & b

| (Bitwise OR):
Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the bits is 1.
Example: a | b

^ (Bitwise XOR):
Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1.
Example: a ^ b

~ (Bitwise NOT):
Inverts all the bits.
Example: ~a

<< (Left Shift):
Shifts bits to the left by the specified number of positions.
Example: a << 1

>> (Right Shift):
Shifts bits to the right by the specified number of positions.
Example: a >> 1

Bitwise operators are typically used in situations where direct manipulation of bits is necessary, such as in cryptography, device drivers, graphics, and memory-efficient computations.

conclusion:
In this experiment, we successfully studied and implemented various C++ bitwise operators such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>). These operators allowed us to perform efficient binary-level operations on integer data. Understanding and applying bitwise operators is essential for optimizing performance in low-level programming and for solving problems that involve binary logic and data masking.
